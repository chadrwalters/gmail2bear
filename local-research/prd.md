# Gmail to Bear Integration - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Gmail to Bear is a Python-based automation tool that monitors a Gmail inbox for emails from specific senders and automatically converts them into Bear notes using customizable templates. The tool runs on macOS, initially as a manually executed script and later as a background service.

## Problem Statement
Users who receive important information via email often need to manually transfer this content to note-taking applications for better organization and long-term storage. This process is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to information loss or inconsistent note formatting.

## Target Users
- Knowledge workers who use Gmail and Bear.app
- Researchers who collect information via email
- Professionals who need to archive specific emails in a more accessible format
- Anyone who wants to automate the transfer of email content to Bear notes

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to automatically save emails from specific senders to Bear so I don't have to manually copy and paste content.
2. As a user, I want processed emails to be marked as read and archived in Gmail to keep my inbox clean.
3. As a user, I want to customize how email content is formatted in Bear notes to maintain consistency.
4. As a user, I want the tool to run in the background without requiring my attention.
5. As a user, I want to be able to configure which email senders trigger the automation.
6. As a user, I want to ensure no duplicate notes are created if the same email is processed multiple times.
7. As a user, I want a simple way to configure the application so that I can customize it to my needs without editing code.
8. As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Requirements

### Phased Implementation Approach
The project will be implemented in phases, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and adding features incrementally:

#### Phase 1: MVP
- Monitor Gmail for emails from a single, configurable sender
- Process plain text email content only
- Create Bear notes with basic formatting
- Mark processed emails as read
- Track processed emails to prevent duplicates
- Run as a manually executed script
- Basic error handling and logging

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Support for multiple sender emails
- HTML email processing with Markdown conversion
- Customizable note templates
- Email archiving in Gmail
- Improved error handling and recovery
- More comprehensive logging

#### Phase 3: Background Service
- Run as a background service using macOS Launch Agent
- Automatic startup and recovery
- System notifications for critical events
- Advanced configuration options

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Functionality
1. Monitor Gmail inbox for new emails from configured sender(s)
2. Extract email content (subject, body, date, sender)
3. Create Bear notes using a customizable template
4. Mark processed emails as read and archive them in Gmail
5. Prevent duplicate processing of emails
6. Run as a background service on macOS (in later phases)

#### Configuration
1. Support for specifying target email sender(s)
2. Customizable polling frequency (default: 5 minutes)
3. Configurable Bear note template with placeholders for email fields
4. Adjustable logging level for troubleshooting

#### Authentication Management
1. Secure storage of OAuth tokens
2. Automatic token refresh when expired
3. Detection of authentication failures
4. User notification when manual reauthorization is required
5. Simple reauthorization process
6. Service recovery after successful reauthorization

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
1. Minimal CPU and memory usage during idle periods
2. Process new emails within one polling cycle
3. No noticeable impact on system performance

#### Reliability
1. Automatic recovery from transient errors (network issues, API rate limits)
2. Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
3. Persistent tracking of processed emails to prevent duplicates
4. Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

#### Security
1. Secure handling of Gmail API credentials:
   - Encrypted storage of tokens with proper key derivation
   - Restricted file permissions (owner-only access)
   - Separation of sensitive credentials from configuration
2. No storage of email content beyond what's needed for processing
3. Use of OAuth for secure Gmail API authentication
4. Protection against token exposure or unauthorized access
5. Input validation for all external data

#### Usability
1. Simple configuration via a settings file
2. Clear documentation for setup and customization
3. Informative error messages for troubleshooting
4. No UI interaction required during normal operation

## Constraints
1. macOS only (due to Bear.app dependency)
2. Requires Google API credentials and OAuth setup
3. Internet connectivity required for Gmail API access

## Success Metrics
1. Zero manual transfers needed for emails from configured senders
2. No duplicate Bear notes created
3. Minimal user intervention required after initial setup
4. Reliable operation across system restarts

## MVP Definition
The Minimum Viable Product will include:
1. Gmail API authentication with OAuth2
2. Fetching emails from a single, configurable sender
3. Processing plain text email content
4. Creating Bear notes with basic formatting
5. Marking processed emails as read
6. Tracking processed emails in a simple text file
7. Running as a manually executed script
8. Basic console logging

## Out of Scope
1. Processing email attachments
2. Web or mobile interfaces
3. Support for note-taking apps other than Bear
4. Support for email providers other than Gmail
5. Two-way synchronization between Gmail and Bear
6. Advanced HTML processing (for MVP)
7. Multiple sender support (for MVP)

## Future Considerations
1. Support for Gmail push notifications instead of polling
2. Handling of email attachments
3. More advanced email filtering options
4. Integration with additional note-taking applications
5. Web-based configuration interface
