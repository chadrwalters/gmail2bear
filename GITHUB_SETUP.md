# GitHub Repository Setup

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your code:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "gmail2bear" as the repository name
4. Add a description: "A Python application that automatically converts emails from Gmail to notes in Bear"
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility as per your preference
6. **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Add the GitHub Repository as a Remote

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gmail2bear.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## 3. Push Your Code to GitHub

Push your code to GitHub with the following command:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

This will push your code to the GitHub repository and set up tracking between your local `main` branch and the remote `main` branch.

## 4. Verify the Repository

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gmail2bear` in your web browser
2. Verify that all your files are present in the repository

## Next Steps

Now that your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. Set up branch protection rules
2. Create issue templates
3. Set up a project board
4. Add topics to your repository
5. Continue development according to the implementation plan
